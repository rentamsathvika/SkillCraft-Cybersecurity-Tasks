## 🔐 Task Overview

### 🧩 Task 1 — Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption
A Python program that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt messages** using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.  
Users can input custom shift values to secure messages with basic substitution-based encryption.

### 🖼️ Task 2 — Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation
Developed a tool to **encrypt and decrypt images** by manipulating pixel values.  
Techniques such as **pixel swapping** and **arithmetic transformations** were applied to achieve a basic layer of image data security.

### 🧮 Task 3 — Password Strength Analyzer
Implemented a **password analysis tool** that evaluates the strength of a password based on:
- Length and character diversity  
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters  
- Real-time feedback for improving password robustness  

### 🎹 Task 4 — Simulated Keylogger
Created a **simulated keylogger** using Python’s `keyboard` module to understand how keystroke logging works in cybersecurity.  
Focused on **ethical implementation** and **secure logging** for educational purposes.
